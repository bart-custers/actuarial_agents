  "consistency_check": "The summary provided in the Model Metrics Consistency Summary indicates that the consistency of the outcome of the modelling phase is not ideal.

The low mean and standard deviation suggest that the feature is not capturing any significant patterns in the data, and the lack of correlation with the predictor variables further supports this conclusion.\n\nIn summary, the consistency of the outcome of the modelling phase is not ideal, and the Coefficient feature does not provide any meaningful insights into the claim frequency data.",
