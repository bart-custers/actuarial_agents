Assignment: Evaluate the dataprep of a frequency prediction model for insurance claims.\nRole: Actuarial Assistant.\n\n2. Most relevant actions for evaluation:\n\n* DataPrepAgent:\n\t+ Evaluate the quality and relevance of the data used for model training.\n\t+ Assess the effectiveness of the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.\n* ModellingAgent:\n\t+ Evaluate the performance of the trained model in predicting claim frequencies.\n\t+ Assess the model's accuracy and precision in estimating claim frequencies.\n\t+ Analyze the model's performance in different sub-groups of data (e.g., by policy type, claim type, etc.).",
