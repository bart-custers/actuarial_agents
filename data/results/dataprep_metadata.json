Let's dive into the details of each step and why they're important:\n\n1. Clipping VehAge (<=20): This step involves clipping the values of the \"VehAge\" column to a maximum value of 20. This is important because the age of a vehicle can have a significant impact on its value, and we want to ensure that the values we're working with are reasonable and not outside the expected range. By clipping the values, we can avoid any potential issues with the model's predictions.\n2. DrivAge (<=90): Similar to the previous step, this involves clipping the values of the \"DrivAge\" column to a maximum value of 90. This is important because the age of a driver can also impact their risk level, and we want to make sure that the values we're working with are reasonable and not outside the expected range.\n3. BonusMalus (<=150): This step involves scaling the values of the \"BonusMalus\" column to a maximum value of 150. This is important because the bonus malus rating can have a significant impact on the overall risk level of a policyholder, and we want to ensure that the values we're working with are reasonable and not outside the expected range.\n4. ClaimNb (<=5): This step involves clipping the values of the \"ClaimNb\" column to a maximum value of 5. This is important because the number of claims a policyholder has can impact their risk level, and we want to make sure that the values we're working with are reasonable and not outside the expected range.\n5. Mapped Area categories to numeric scale (A\u21921,...,F\u21926): This step involves mapping the categories of the \"Area\" column to a numeric scale. This is important because the area where a policyholder lives can impact their risk level, and we want to ensure that the values we're working with are reasonable and not outside the expected range.\n6. Dropped 0 rows with missing values: This step involves dropping any rows with missing values in the dataset. This is important because missing values can impact the accuracy of the model's predictions, and we want to ensure that the data we're working with is complete and accurate.\n7. Defined 5 numerical and 3 categorical features: This step involves defining the numerical and categorical features of the dataset. This is important because the features we choose can impact the accuracy of the model's predictions, and we want to ensure that we're working with the most relevant features possible.\n8. Split data: 610211 train / 67802 test observations: This step involves splitting the data into training and testing sets. This is important because we want to be able to evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set to ensure that it's accurate and reliable.\n9. Generated 40 feature columns after encoding: This step involves encoding the numerical features of the dataset to ensure that they're in a format that can be used by the machine learning algorithm. This is important because the algorithm needs to be able to work with the data in a consistent format to ensure that it's accurate and reliable.\n\nOverall, each of these steps is important because they help ensure that the data we're working with is accurate, complete, and relevant to the task at hand. By following these steps, we can build a more accurate and reliable machine learning model that can help us better understand and predict the risk level of policyholders.",
