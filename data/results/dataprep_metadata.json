Here's why they're important:\n\n1. Clipping VehAge (<=20): This step is essential to remove any extreme values in the VehAge column, which could affect the accuracy of the model. By clipping the values to a range of -20 to 20, we ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular age group.\n2. DrivAge (<=90): Similar to VehAge, this step helps to remove any extreme values in the DrivAge column. By limiting the values to a range of -90 to 90, we can improve the accuracy of the model and prevent any bias towards a particular age group.\n3. BonusMalus (<=150): This step is crucial in removing any errors or inconsistencies in the BonusMalus column. By limiting the values to a range of -150 to 150, we can ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular bonus malus value.\n4. ClaimNb (<=5): This step is important in removing any duplicate or irrelevant claims data. By limiting the values to a range of -5 to 5, we can improve the accuracy of the model and prevent any bias towards a particular claim frequency.\n\nNow, let's talk about the mapping of Area categories to a numeric scale. This step is crucial in converting categorical data into numerical data, which can be easily analyzed and modeled. By mapping the Area categories to a numeric scale (A to F), we can use numerical features in our model, which can provide more accurate predictions.\n\nNext, we dropped the 0 rows with missing values. This step is important in removing any incomplete or inconsistent data, which can affect the accuracy of the model. By removing these rows, we can ensure that our model is based on complete and accurate data.\n\nFinally, we defined 5 numerical and 3 categorical features. The numerical features are useful in capturing the continuous values in the data, such as the ages of the drivers. The categorical features are useful in capturing the categorical",
