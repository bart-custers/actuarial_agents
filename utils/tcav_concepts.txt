Risk is a function of exposure and frequency.
Use GLM to estimate the claim frequency.
Check calibration and predictive deviance.
We evaluate model fit with AIC and residuals.
Use Poisson or negative binomial for counts.
Include exposure offset for policy period.
Feature interactions should be interpretable.
Check stability across policy years.
Holdout and cross-validation for validation.
Provide confidence intervals for predicted rates.
